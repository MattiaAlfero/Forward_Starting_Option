# How to price a Forward Starting Option
The purpose of the project is to show how to price a forward starting option using a european option (vanilla). The slides "FSO_pricing.pdf" shows a brief introduction to B&S framework and how to price a european option. Then, it shows how to price a forward starting option using the law of iterated expectations, and exploiting the observed price of a european option. 
The code is very simple and it is used to compare the montecarlo simulation and the closed form solution. Moreover, it also shows the speed of convergence.
